          <p class="fade-in stagger-item" data-stagger-group="about">
            I am an accomplished Head of Engineering with over three decades of
            experience driving technological innovation and leading
            high-performing teams globally.
          </p>
          <p class="fade-in stagger-item" data-stagger-group="about">
            My career spans from pioneering web development in the late 90s to
            leading complex software, hardware, and firmware initiatives. I
            bring deep technical expertise in .NET, Python, JS, React, modern
            web technologies, cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), and system
            architecture, combined with a passion for mentoring talent and
            building diverse, inclusive engineering cultures.

          <p class="fade-in stagger-item" data-stagger-group="about">
            Starting June 2025, I am leading the Wiser Home team at Schneider

          <p class="fade-in stagger-item" data-stagger-group="about">
            Throughout my career, I have collaborated with teams and companies
            across nearly every continent — working with engineers, designers,
            and product leaders from Europe, Asia, North America, Australia, and
            beyond. This global exposure has shaped my leadership style,
            strengthened my cultural awareness, and enabled me to build
            high-performing distributed teams that operate with clarity, trust,
            and shared ownership.

          My Engineering Leadership Philosophy

          Organizations thrive when their people thrive. My primary goal is to

          I believe in recognizing that every individual is unique, bringing

          By fostering a culture of ownership, continuous learning, and open

          high-performing teams. Leading teams of up to 100 people reinforces
          the need for scalable people-centric practices and robust processes.
